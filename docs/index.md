# AI Image Editor Overview

Welcome to the public project page for the AI-powered image editor. This site summarizes the vision, roadmap, and setup guidance. Phase 1 shell is now active with an interactive canvas and core tooling.

## Project Vision

Build a web-based editor that merges traditional tooling with AI-driven generation and editing. Key services include:

- **Google Gemini Image (‚ÄúNano Banana‚Äù)** for consistent image generation and edit chains.
- **OpenAI GPT Image** for high-fidelity prompt following and multi-turn refinements.
- **Convex** as the realtime backend and orchestration layer.
- **UploadThing** for asset ingestion and CDN-backed delivery.
- **Clerk** delivering authentication and session management.

See the full plan in [`ai-image-editor-plan.md`](../ai-image-editor-plan.md) for a deep dive into use cases, architecture, and open questions.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Monorepo with Next.js App Router (`apps/web`) + Convex backend scaffold
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 shell: Konva canvas with pan/zoom, selection, resize/rotate via Transformer
- ‚úÖ Layers: add/remove, show/hide, drag-and-drop reorder + keyboard shortcuts
- ‚úÖ Properties: numeric x/y/w/h/rotation bound to selection
- ‚úÖ Tools: Brush/Eraser with size and color
- ‚úÖ Assets: thumbnails (uploads/AI previews) with insert-to-canvas
- ‚úÖ AI UI: parameters + mocked generation; previews grid
- ‚úÖ Autosave: debounced; local revisions (last 10) with restore UI
- ‚úÖ Testing & CI: Vitest unit tests, Playwright smoke e2e, GitHub Actions Web CI
- üöß In flight: multi-select + group/ungroup scaffold (PR #17)
- üìå Next: snap-to-angles, Convex-backed revisions (env-gated), upload thumbnails, real AI providers

More details live inside [`docs/phase-0-status.md`](phase-0-status.md).

## Getting Started Locally

1. Install prerequisites: Node.js 18+, pnpm 9+, Convex CLI (`npm install -g convex`).
2. Duplicate `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env` and populate values (Clerk keys, UploadThing, Convex, OpenAI, Gemini).
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Run the web app and Convex server in separate terminals:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter web dev
   pnpm --filter convex-backend dev
   ```
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and authenticate via Clerk to access `/editor`.

Consult [`docs/clerk-production-checklist.md`](clerk-production-checklist.md) before deploying to production.

## Roadmap Snapshot

| Phase | Focus | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 | Foundations | Repository scaffold, auth wiring, mocked AI surface, UploadThing SSR bridge + Convex logging, documentation |
| Phase 1 | Interactive Editor + mocked AI | Konva canvas, layers/properties, autosave + local revisions, AI previews |
| Phase 2 | AI Editing | Masking tools, inpainting, streaming previews, prompt revision surfacing |
| Phase 3 | Collaboration | Presence, commenting, activity feeds, Convex workflows |
| Phase 4 | Production polish | Accessibility, telemetry, performance tuning, deployment automation |

## Deployment Notes

GitHub Pages hosts this documentation (`/docs` directory). The interactive editor itself requires a runtime (Vercel + Convex) due to Clerk authentication and server-side coordination. Use this page to communicate project updates while development continues.
