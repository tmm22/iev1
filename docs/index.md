# AI Image Editor Overview

Welcome to the public project page for the AI-powered image editor. This site summarizes the vision, roadmap, and setup guidance surfaced during Phase 0 of development.

## Project Vision

Build a web-based editor that merges traditional tooling with AI-driven generation and editing. Key services include:

- **Google Gemini Image (‚ÄúNano Banana‚Äù)** for consistent image generation and edit chains.
- **OpenAI GPT Image** for high-fidelity prompt following and multi-turn refinements.
- **Convex** as the realtime backend and orchestration layer.
- **UploadThing** for asset ingestion and CDN-backed delivery.
- **Clerk** delivering authentication and session management.

See the full plan in [`ai-image-editor-plan.md`](../ai-image-editor-plan.md) for a deep dive into use cases, architecture, and open questions.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Monorepo scaffold with Next.js App Router (`apps/web`) and Convex backend stub (`convex/`).
- ‚úÖ Phase 0 editor shell with AI prompt/asset panels and undo/redo state powered by Zustand.
- ‚úÖ Clerk authentication wired through middleware, sign-in/up routes, and session-aware UI.
- ‚úÖ UploadThing route live via `/api/uploadthing`; provide keys to enable real uploads.
- üìå Pending: Convex function implementation, AI provider integration, and production hardening.

More details live inside [`docs/phase-0-status.md`](phase-0-status.md).

## Getting Started Locally

1. Install prerequisites: Node.js 18+, pnpm 9+, Convex CLI (`npm install -g convex`).
2. Duplicate `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env` and populate values (Clerk keys, UploadThing, Convex, OpenAI, Gemini).
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Run the web app and Convex server in separate terminals:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter web dev
   pnpm --filter convex-backend dev
   ```
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and authenticate via Clerk to access `/editor`.

Consult [`docs/clerk-production-checklist.md`](clerk-production-checklist.md) before deploying to production.

## Roadmap Snapshot

| Phase | Focus | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 | Foundations | Repository scaffold, auth wiring, mocked AI surface, live UploadThing bridge, documentation |
| Phase 1 | AI Generation | Integrate Gemini & OpenAI generation calls, job tracking, gallery |
| Phase 2 | AI Editing | Masking tools, inpainting, streaming previews, prompt revision surfacing |
| Phase 3 | Collaboration | Presence, commenting, activity feeds, Convex workflows |
| Phase 4 | Production polish | Accessibility, telemetry, performance tuning, deployment automation |

## Deployment Notes

GitHub Pages hosts this documentation (`/docs` directory). The interactive editor itself requires a runtime (Vercel + Convex) due to Clerk authentication and server-side coordination. Use this page to communicate project updates while development continues.
